1 > About Maps	      |
=======================

UpChomp maps and tile files are simply INI files. The tile files define what the
tiles look like and what they do and the map file defines where the tiles go.

=======================
2 > Tile Files        |
=======================

The tile file could also be described as a theme file as it defines the look of 
the level. However, it also defines what each tile can do and this can be varied
from tile file to tile file. The tile file can be broken into two parts the theme
settings and the tile information.

== Theme Settings ==

Bellow is an example of how the theme settings should look like...

    [tiles]
    tileset = mytiles.png
    tile_width = 256
    tile_height = 256
    animation_framerate = 45

    [background]
    images = background1.png,background2.png
    paralax = 16,8
    no_repeat_y = 0
    fit_to_window = 0
    color = 255,255,255

    [music]
    file = mymusic.ogg


First off the theme settings are split into three groups. Bellow is a description 
of each item in each group.

[tiles]

tileset =       Image file containing all the tiles.

tile_width =    The width of each tile.

tile_height =   The height of each tile.

animation_
framerate =     Frame rate to play tile animation at.


[background]

images =        Images to use in the background. You may define as many
                layers as you want, seperate them with a comma. The top
                layer is the first one and goes down from there.

paralax =       The distance each background should move when the screen
                scrolls. Also seperated by commas and should be in the
                same order as the images above.

no_repeat_y =   If true then the backgrounds won't repeat vertically.

fit_to_window =	If true the background images are resized to fit the window.

color =         Defines the color to use on the background. Displays as the
                bottom most layer. It's should be setup as Red,Green,Blue.

[music]

file =          Music file to play.


=== Tile Settings ===

Each group after the inital three settings define the various tiles in the level.
The group names for the tiles should be one character long and are used in the map
file to represent the defined tile.

Here is an example of a tile...

    [>]
    name = right spring
    collide = true
    tile = 4
    animation = 7
    animate_on_collide = true
    type = pusher
    value = 11,0
    collide_sfx = spring.wav
    orientation = 270deg

The above is a side ways spring. Here is what everything does...

[>] =       This represents the group. This is the group for the ">" character. That 
            character represents the sideways spring tile and will be used in the map 
            file.

name =      Not really important, there to keep the tile maker organized for easy
            reference, might be used later if a map maker is made.

collide =   Determines rather or not the game should check this tile for collisions.
            The action executed when the collision occurs depends of the 
            type(see below). If no type is defined then it becomes a wall/floor that 
            cannot be passed.

tile =		The tile number in the tileset file. The top left tile is one and it counts
            up from left to right.

animation =	The tile number that the animation ends on, 'tile' is assumed to be the
            starting frame. If this is left blank then this tile is assumed to have no
            animation.

animate_on_
collide	=	Determines if the animation should continually loop or only play when Chompy
            collides with this tile.

type =      Determines what the tile does. The various types include...

                pusher:     Pushes Chompy in a direct specified by the value.

                lock:       Impassible tile until unlocked with a 'key' object.
				            The value determines what key it will accept.

                key:        Unlocks a 'lock' type object. The value determines
                            what locks it will open.

                water:      Stops all of Chompy's horizontal movement and slows
				            his vertical movement.
	
                goal:       The end point of the level, the goal!


value =     Certain tile types need this bellow describes what the values should be for
            certain types...

                pusher:     The X and Y ammount to push Chompy. Seperate X and Y with a
                            comma in that order. Negatives push Chompy to the left and 
                            up respectively.

                key/lock:   An interger that determines which locks are opened with which
                            key. Basically if you want to open all lock tiles with a value
                            of 1, set the key's value to 1 as well.


collide_
sfx =       A sound file to play when Chompy collides with this tile. Only works if
		    collide is true.

orient... = Direction to rotate tile in . Possible values are as follows...

                v-flip:         Flips the tile vertically.
                90deg:          Rotates 90 degrees.
                90deg_v-flip:   Rotates 90 degrees and flips vertically.
                180deg:         Rotates 180 degrees.
                180deg_v-flip:  Rotates 180 degrees and flips vertically.
                270deg:         Rotates 270 degrees.
                270deg_v-flip:  Rotates 180 degrees and flips vertically.


=======================
3 > Map Files         |
=======================

Map files, also known as map packs, can contain an unlimited number of maps. Map files
have one group of settings and the rest of the groups are for the maps.

The first group called "pack" looks like this...

    [pack]
    name = My Awesome Map
    desc = My Awesome Description
    order = map1,map2,map3


And here is what everything does...

[pack]

name =      Name of the map pack that is displayed on the map pack screen.

desc =      Description of the map... not yet implemented in the game.

order =     Order each map should appear in. Players cannot player subsuquient maps
            until they beat the prior one. Each map name should be split by commas.
            The map name is the group the map is placed in.


Follow the map pack details are the maps, here is an example of a map...

    [map1]
    theme = mytheme
    startpos = 2,5
    name = My Map Name
    desc = My Map Description
    skills = up,heli
    arank = 10.0
    map = =......................................................
          |......................................................
          |..................................................C..L
          |.....*..^...*..O..^..O..*.O..^...*..O...^..*.........=
          |.....=========================================.......|
          |.....|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||.......|
          |.^.U.|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||..^..*.|
          |=====|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||=======|


And a description of what everything does...

[map1]

theme =     The filename of the tile file to use without the ".ini"

startpos =  The position Chompy starts in, X and Y seperated by a comma. It represents
            the tile Chompy will start on with 0,0 being the top left.

name =      Name of map displayed on the map select screen and start dialog.

desc =      Map description displayed on the start dialog.

skills =    Skills Chompy can use on this map. Each skill should be seperated with
            a comma. To have more then one of the same skill simply put it in multiple
            times like "up,up."

            SKILLS:

            up:	    Allows Chompy to bounce up as if on a spring.
            heli:   Allows Chompy to hover in the air for a short period.


arank =     The time in seconds required to beat the map with an "A-Rank" rating.

map =       The map, a long string of characters from the tile file where each represents
            a tile. Each line should be the exact same number of character, spaces are 
            ignored.
