=======================
1 > About the Game    |
=======================

UpChomp is a platformer/puzzle game. It stars Chompy, a character with no arms
or feet and thus cannot walk. He can move himself forward only when in the air
and can only move forward with his remaining momentum when on the ground. The
player must use springs, conveyors, and various power ups to help Chompy reach
his goal.

What's the goal?! Chompy is hungry... and a giant cookie awaits him at the end
of the level. Feed him as fast as you can!

=======================
