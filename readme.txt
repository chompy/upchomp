=======================
1 > About the Game    |
=======================

UpChomp is a platformer/puzzle game. It stars Chompy, a character with no arms
or feet and thus cannot walk. He can move himself forward only when in the air
and can only move forward with his remaining momentum when on the ground. The
player must use springs, conveyors, and various power ups to help Chompy reach
his goal.

What's the goal?! Chompy is hungry... and a giant cookie awaits him at the end
of the level. Feed him as fast as you can!

=======================
2 > How to Play       |
=======================

UpChomp can be played in one of four ways...

MOUSE:

  * Move by clicking and holding on the left or right side of the screen.
  * Use skills by clicking their icons at the bottom left.
  * Best when using a multitouch touchscreen.

MOUSE + KEYBOARD:

  * Move by clicking and holding on the left or right side of the screen.
  * Use skills by pressing 1-9 on the keyboard where the farthest left skill is 1.
  * Best for playing on a standard PC.

KEYBOARD:

  * Move with the left and right arrow keys.
  * Use skills by pressing 1-9 on the keyboard where the farthest left skill is 1.
  * Good alternative to the above...however menus doesn't yet support the 
    keyboard.

ACCELEROMETER + TOUCHSCREEN:

  * Move by tilting the device left or right.
  * Use skills by taping their icons at the bottom left.
